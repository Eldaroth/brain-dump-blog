<br />

## Writeup
1) Open Webpage and then Dev Tools in Browser (F12)
2) While looking at the HTML code, we find flag 1/3 in a comment under
   ``` html
   <div id="tababout> [...]
   <!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->
   ```
3) Flag 2/3 can be found as a comment in the stylesheet `mycss.css` (see Style Editor of Dev Tools):
**t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t**
4) Looking at the Debugger Console, we see a JavaScript file `myjs.js`:
   Going through the code, on the bottom there is part 3/3 of the flag: **\_lucky?f10be399}**

# where are the robots
## Description
Can you find the robots? [Link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/60915/) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:60915

## Writeup
In order to find this flag we need to have a look at the robots.txt ([What Is Robots.txt](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-robots.txt/)) file. We can do that by editing the URL by adding **/robots.txt** to the end of the URL. This opens the robots.txt file:
``` html
User-agent: *
Disallow: /8028f.html
```
By adding **/8028f.html** to the end of the URL we received in the robots.txt file, we get to the flag.
