On my journey to learn more about Linux, I try to note down as much as I can for later reference and to share my experiences with others.

A lot comes from online research (The Google Fu is strong with this one...). I can only recommend to have a look at "The Linux Command Line" by William Shotts as well. Great ressource which you can find for free under linuxcommand.org!
